In this project, you can see a classification problem when I used different algorithms to create a better model.
I try to detect a possible malware.

1. Data Understanding.
   I create different keys for understanding data and the problem.

2. Insights.
   I get insights to understand the business problem and which variables can help to the algorithms predict better. 

3. Data Cleaning.
   In this step, drop some columns because it's self explanatory or little explanatory. Also, there were a lot of labels and I consider grouping for reducing them so that the      model learns better
   
5. Data Preparation.
   Transform different data and One Hot Encoding for categorical labels. The algorithms need all numerical labels.

6. Modelling.
   Continue to decide which algorithm use to create us model. In this case, I use different for compare after. XGBoostregressor, Decision Tree and Random Forest              Regressor.

8. Instantiate the model
   Indicate to the algorithms the parameters and fit it.
   
10. Evaluation model.
    In the end, need an evaluation model for deciding how well it does it. I use some parameters: AUC, Accuracy, ROC Curve, F1 Score and Confusión matrix. All of them help us       to decide the best model for the problem.
